It is common to use 3 x 3 on small images and 5 x 5 or 7 x 7 and more on larger image sizes.\n","\n","- **Stride Width**: Use the default stride of 1. It is easy to understand and you don't need padding to handle the receptive field falling off the edge of your images. This could be increased to 2 or larger for larger images.\n","\n","- **Number of Filters**: Filters are the feature detectors. Generally fewer filters are used at the input layer and increasingly more filters used at deeper layers.\n","\n","- **Padding**: Set to zero and called zero padding when reading non-input data. This is useful when you cannot or do not want to standardize input image sizes or when you want to use receptive field and stride sizes that do not neatly divide up the input image size.\n","\n","- **Pooling**: Pooling is a destructive or generalization process to reduce overfitting. Receptive field size is almost always set to 2 x 2 with a stride of 2 to discard 75% of the activations from the output of the previous layer.\n","\n","- **Data Preparation**: Consider standardizing input data, both the dimensions of the images and pixel values.\n","\n","- **Pattern Architecture**: It is common to pattern the layers in your network architecture. This might be one, two or some number of convolutional layers followed by a pooling layer. This structure can then be repeated one or more times. Finally, fully connected layers are\n","often only used at the output end and may be stacked one, two or more deep.\n","\n","- **Dropout**: CNNs have a habit of overfitting, even with pooling layers. Dropout should be used such as between fully connected layers and perhaps after pooling layers."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"VEoAbaOKFz1j","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1634123836978,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Christian Kauth","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi3-aO9Ea873CYWBJu-flxslweQj0T7KM2WKzfx=s64","userId":"03504929373507274108"}}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
